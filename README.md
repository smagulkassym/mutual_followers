# mutual_followers
I wanted to check whom I am following without them following me back, so I wrote a small Python script to compare two lists. 

```
Step 1: Download your data from Instagram. (I received it in HTML format)
```

```
Step 2: Put Script in the same folder with both the following and followers files
```

```
Step 3: Launch Script. It will return to the console.
```
